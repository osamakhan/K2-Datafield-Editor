K2 Blackpearl is an awesome BPM framework, but it has one single major shortcoming when it comes to support tools : Editing running processes.

Once a process instance has been initiated, you can no longer update any data inflight.

This can cause problems in scenarios where your process reads data from third party sources into your datafields. Data might be wrong or missing and this causes your process to go into error state.

The K2 Blackpearl DataField Editor allows you to connect to any K2BP server, edit all DataFields and XmlFields, then update them with a single click.
